- Introduced versine functions (utkramajya)
- Contained methods for calculating instantaneous planetary motion
- Used techniques for infinitesimal differences
- Developed procedures resembling differential calculus for astronomical calculations
- Advanced interpolation methods
- Sophisticated trigonometric systems

2. Aryabhata (476-550 CE):
- Developed methods for solving differential equations
- Used sine and versine functions
- Applied infinite series expansions
